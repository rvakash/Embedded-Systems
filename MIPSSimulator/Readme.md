# __PetriNet Simulator for MIPS Processor__
* Name : Akash R Vasishta 
* UFID : 53955080
* Date : 02/26/2018

The model will use colored tokens (token with values) rather than the default Petri net. Simulator should be able to generate step-by-step simulation of the Petri net model of the MIPS processor described below.
